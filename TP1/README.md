## Comments

The crawler was tested on a limited set of ten pages.
The extracted URLs are sorted before comparison to avoid differences caused by link order.
Some differences remain between the expected results and the obtained results, especially for product titles and extracted links.
These differences are most likely due to updates or structural changes on the target website.
